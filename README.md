analysis.

### Entry and Exit Points

Define the criteria for entering and exiting trades based on technical
indicators, chart patterns, or fundamental events.

    trading capital).
-   Use stop-loss orders.
-   Diversify your trades.

### Record Keeping

Maintain a trading journal to document your trades, strategies, and
performance.

## Practical Examples of Trading Strategies

### Trend Following Strategy

Use moving averages to identify the direction of the trend. Enter trades
in the direction of the trend when the price retraces to the moving
average.

### Breakout Strategy

Identify key support and resistance levels. Enter trades when the price
breaks out of these levels, indicating a potential new trend.

### News Trading Strategy

Trade based on major news events. Monitor economic calendars and enter
trades just before or after significant announcements, considering the
expected impact on asset prices.

## Trading Psychology

### Discipline

Stick to your trading plan and avoid impulsive decisions.

### Patience

Wait for clear trading signals and avoid overtrading.

### Emotional Control

Manage your emotions, especially after losses. Avoid revenge trading and
stick to your risk management rules.
